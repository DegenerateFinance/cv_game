# School proyect : cv_game

The goal of this proyect is to cleate a game to help in a rehabilitation process of patients that had neurological damage

I created a prototipe based on computer vision. The gane functions as follows:

1. The camera is opened and the patient is asked to center himself in a certain position, then he can press start

2. When the game start, the player has to hold his hand inside the target for a certain time. If achieved, score is added and game progresses. If not achieved, game is over.

3. Finally, some sensitive data is exported into a csv file
